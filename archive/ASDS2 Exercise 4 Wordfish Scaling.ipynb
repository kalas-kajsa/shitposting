    "In this and the next two exercise labs, we will be working with a dataset of tweets from USA Members of Congress. The version of the dataset used today includes the 3000 most recent tweets from each member of congress. We have created a subset of this dataset containing tweets from 2018 and later, to capture only fairly recent tweets as the dataset is very large. \n",
    "\n",
    "Preprocessing such a large dataset takes a while to run (approx 20 mins). To save you time and effort, we have uploaded a preprocessed version of the dataset: 'MOC2021_Tweets_2018subset_preprocessed.csv'. \n",
    "\n",
    "However, if you have time and wish to replicate the preprocessing yourself, the following steps were applied: \n",
    "\n",
    "1. Subsetting dataset to include only tweets from 2018 and later\n",
    "1. Removing duplicated tweets \n",
    "2. Removing unneeded columns (all except 'nominate_name','affiliation','role','nominate_score', and 'text')\n",
    "3. Turning independents into Democrats or Republicans. In essence, finding the independents (\"SANDERS, Bernard\" and \"KING, Angus Stanley, Jr.\") and turning these to \"Democrat\". \n",
    "4. Replace \"&\" with \"and\"\n",
    "5. Remove odd special characters (\"┻\",\"┃\",\"━\",\"┳\",\"┓\",\"┏\",\"┛\",\"┗\")\n",
    "6. There are some annoying cases in these data where a character that looks like a space is not a space. Here, we just replace that character with an actual space. Note that the first \"space\" is not actually a space. \" \" == \" \" is FALSE. Replace \"\\u202F\", \"\\u2069\", \"\\u200d\", and \"\\u2066\" with \" \".\n",
    "7. Removing \"RT\" and \"via\"\n",
    "8. Removing mentions (@someone)\n",
    "9. Removing numbers, removing punctuation (except hyphens), removing separators, removing urls, lowercasing, removing stopwords, and lemmatizing."

In essence, transform the dataframe so that each row has one politician (rather than one tweet) and each text field includes all tweets from this politician in one long string. \n",
